I'm Data Analyst with Master of Public Health in Epidemiology and Biostatistics. I translate large datasets into useful insights for decision making. I use R, Python, Stata, SQL Server and Excel (if I have to!). When I'm not working, I can be found teaching myself JavaScript data visualisation library D3.js and exploring machine learning and/or at a cafe somewhere in Melbourne.
